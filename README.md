# Group-404-CryptoGraph
The code for our team project; a simple cryptograph
# Overview

This is our Android app Cryptograph designed to encrypt, decrypt, or simply convert any message.

# Instructions 

* Open Server.java and ClientHandler.java in VScode. Run Server.java.
* Open everything else in Android Studios. 
* Run two instances on MainActivity on the Pixel 2 API 30.
######Start with phone one
* Press the connect button, enter your name into the 'Code:' input then select 'English' on the left side and 'English' on the right side. 
* Then click 'Translate.' This gives you a username and allows the server to distinguish between clients. If two clients have the same username the server will not send messages between those clients.
* Give phone two a username like you did for phone one.
* If you did it right phone one will receive a popup at the bottom (the UI keyboard will cover the popup, so put that off the screen) that says that phone two has connected to the group. 
* You may now send messages back and forth in whatever language you please.
