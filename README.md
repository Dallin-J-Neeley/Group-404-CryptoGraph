# Group-404-CryptoGraph
The code for our team project; a simple cryptograph
# Overview

This is our Android app Cryptograph designed to encrypt, decrypt, or simply convert any message.

# Instructions 
###### Setup environment
* Open Server.java and ClientHandler.java in VScode. 
* Run Server.java.
* Open everything else in Android Studios. 
* Run two instances of MainActivity one on each Pixel 2 API 30.

###### Start with phone one
* Press the connect button. In the Server.java terminal you should see 'A new client has connected.' 
* Enter your name into the 'Code:' input then select 'English' on the left side and 'English' on the right side. 
* Then click 'Translate.' This gives you a username and allows the server to distinguish between clients. If two clients have the same username the server will not send messages between those clients.

###### Phone two
* Give phone two a username like you did for phone one.
* If you did it right phone one will receive a popup at the bottom that says that phone two has connected to the group. 

###### You're good to go!
* You may now send messages back and forth in whatever language you please.
